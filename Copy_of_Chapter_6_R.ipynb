        "Regression analysis is amongst the most widely used methods in science and especially machine learning. In particular, it can helpt to gain insight about a set of data which can helpt to explain the past and extrapolate into the future. This method can be applied to scientific studies, such as in the fields of economics, physics or psychology, for example to quantify the relationship between a dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (the predictors), or to identify patterns that can be used to forecast future behaviour. In statistical modelling this process is known as regression analysis, which will be introduced in the following sections. "

The intercept with the y-axis is given by the term $a$ (when $x=0$).\n",

In practice it is rarely the case that the function perfectly relates those values, so the machine quantifies this error with an additional term. Hence, the smaller that error term, the better is the function to explain the relationship between the $y$ and $x$. \n",
