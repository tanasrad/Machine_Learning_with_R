        "Regression analysis is amongst the most widely used methods in science and especially machine learning. In particular, it can helpt to gain insight about a set of data which can helpt to explain the past and extrapolate into the future. This method can be applied to scientific studies, such as in the fields of economics, physics or psychology, for example to quantify the relationship between a dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (the predictors), or to identify patterns that can be used to forecast future behaviour. In statistical modelling this process is known as regression analysis, which will be introduced in the following sections. "

Since the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are necessary *ingredients* to form a line through the data set, finding their values is inevitable. As usual in real-world problems, finding an exact value, meaning the line passes through every measured data point exactly, is very unlikely. Instead, the line will rather somewhat evenly \"cut\" through the data. Therefore, the resulting values for the parameters (if error > 0) are considered *parameter estimates*. The best estimates are online the ones which generate the smallest error possible. To identify the optimal paramters such that the line is closest to the data points an estimation method known as **ordinary least squares (OLS)** is applied. \n",
