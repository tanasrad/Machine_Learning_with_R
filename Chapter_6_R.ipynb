        "Regression analysis is amongst the most widely used methods in science and especially machine learning. In particular, it can helpt to gain insight about a set of data which can helpt to explain the past and extrapolate into the future. This method can be applied to scientific studies, such as in the fields of economics, physics or psychology, for example to quantify the relationship between a dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (the predictors), or to identify patterns that can be used to forecast future behaviour. In statistical modelling this process is known as regression analysis, which will be introduced in the following sections. "

In practice it is rarely the case that the function perfectly relates those values, so the machine quantifies this error with an additional term. Hence, the smaller that error term, the better is the function to explain the relationship between the $y$ and $x$. \n",

This equation is identical to the equation described previously, beside from the Greek characters which indicate variables that are parameters of statistical functions. As stated above, those parameters (or its estimates) however can be evaluated by performing a regression analysis. Using data from the space shuttle \"Challenger\" launch in 1986 (which went terribly wrong) will give a glimpse how such an analysis can help to gain insight about the data and to test hypotheses. \n",

        "Hence, a regression model that demonstrates the connection between O-ring failures (the dependent variable $y$) and the outside temperature during launch (the independent variable $x$, i.e. the predictor) could predict the possibility of failure given the expected temperature at launch. Since the parameters $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are necessary *ingredients* to form a line through the data set, finding their values is inevitable. As usual in real-world problems, finding an exact value, meaning the line passes through every measured data point exactly, is very unlikely. Instead, the line will rather somewhat evenly \"cut\" through the data. Therefore, the resulting values for the parameters (if error > 0) are considered *parameter estimates*. The best estimates are online the ones which generate the smallest error possible. To identify the optimal paramters such that the line is closest to the data points an estimation method known as **ordinary least squares (OLS)** is applied. "
