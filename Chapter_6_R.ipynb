In particular, it can helpt to gain insight about a set of data which can helpt to explain the past and extrapolate into the future. This method can be applied to scientific studies, such as in the fields of economics, physics or psychology, for example to quantify the relationship between a dependent variable (the value to be predicted) and one or more independent variables (the predictors), or to identify patterns that can be used to forecast future behaviour. In statistical modelling this process is known as regression analysis, which will be introduced in the following sections. "

        "Such simple linear regressions are commonly carried out using the built-in lm function, which was written to fit linear models. It can be used to carry out regressions, single stratum analysis of variance and analysis of covariance. Everything that was described beforehand could have been done with this lm function. Applying the function is simple, the first input `formula` asks for the specifications, which dependent variable should be modelled by which predictor. The `~` operator can be read as \"is being modelled by\". An expression of the form `y ~ model` is interpreted as `y` is modelled by a linear predictor specified symbolically by `model`. In the code below this means `distress_ct` is being modelled by `temperature`. The secont argument `data` asks to specify, from which data set the value for `y` and `x` shoult be taken from. If nothing else is specified, this function will use the default values for the remaining parameters and performing an OLS-regression . The results will be nicely structured, which is very helpful if one is calculating a regression on multiple independent variables. "

        "Interpreting the summary of the regression `model` allows to conclude that the goodness-of-fit (**R-squared**) of the regression model is 0.2613, meaning that the model is able to explain 26.13% of the variance within the data. Basically, R-squared is the ratio of the variance explained by the model and the total variance of the data. Conceptually, the higher R-squared, the smaller the errors between predicted and acutal value, i.e. the closer are the actual data points to the line of the regression model. Logically, the R-squared would increase as more variables are included in the model. Therefore it's advicable to use the **adjusted R-squared** for multiple linear regressions. Another indicator for a good/poor fit is the **P-value**, which gives the probability of observing any value equal or larger than the **t-value**, which is the measure of how many standard deviations the coefficient is far away from 0. Hence, the greater the t-value, the better the model, i.e. higher indication of a relationship between the variables. The P-value for the coefficient is 0.6% which is considered as a good fit (also indicated by the **significance codes**). Hence, the lower the P-value the higher the significance of the estimate. A small value allows for the conclusion for the presence of relationships."
